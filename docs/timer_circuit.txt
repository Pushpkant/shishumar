Timer circuit

1. It should take two inputs each of 2V. One is to turn ON the output and another is to turn OFF the Output.

inputs:

1. SET -- Turn ON the output
2. RESET -- Turn OFF the output

Output:

Turning ON the output --> It will Provide a DC voltage
Turning OFF the output --> Do not provide DC voltage.


Meetings with the Customers:

1. Environment --> Electromagentically noisy environment
2. Output is acatually driving a solenoid valve --> Controlling a pneumatic actuator
3. There is turn ON delay. --> Delay after SET is asserted or become 2V. --> Turn ON the output.
4. There is a turn OFF delay. --> Delay after RESET is asserted or become 2V. --> Turn OFF the output. -->Mode1
5. There is a hold ON delay --> Delay after output is ON the output becomes OFF --> Mode2
6. All the delays are configurable. --> Trimp pot.


Questions:
1. What is the part number of the valve?
2. What kind of noise is there? 
3. What are the ranges of the delays?

Requirement:

1. output --> 5V/6V/12V/24V also NC/NO.
2. Inputs are twisted pair. No need to worry about the transient noise.
3. The intputs are differential.
4. 100mA Input current maximum.
5. 1V as assertion at the input.
6. A reference Ground.
7. All the delaysa are tunable from 100ms to 5000ms.
